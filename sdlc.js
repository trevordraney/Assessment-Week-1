/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const Planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysis = "Deciding what code is going to need to be added where and getting a layout of any new ideas learned from the planning phase "
const Design = "Design is when you actually begin coding and creating a framework of your planning and analysis like where certain sysetems will go etc."
const Implementation = "Implementation is when you execute your vision and write your code to the specifications you made ein planning"
const Testing = "This is your time to run the code and see where errors occur and what systems could run more efficiently"
const Maintain = "When you finally push put your code for users to use they will come across issues and bugs that have not been found yet. You will need to make updates and changes to your code to keep it running smoothly"
